# Graphs CI: This workflow runs once every day and generates response time graphs from the recorded data
# Response Time CI: This workflow records the reponse time of each endpoint and commits it to git history, which is why it runs once every day
# Setup CI: This workflow is triggered after you edit the configuration file, and runs alls steps: checking uptime, tracking response time, updating the README, and generating graphs
# Static Site CI: This workflow builds and deploys your status page website using GitHub Pages. It reads from your configuration and builds the Svelte/Sapper website, then deploys is to the gh-pages branch and triggers a re-build on GitHub Pages.
# Summary CI: This workflow also runs once every day and updates the README of your project with a summary of the response times and generated graphs
# Update Template CI: This workflow runs once a week and updates the internal code of Upptime to make sure you're always on the latest version
# Uptime CI: This workflow runs once every 5 minutes and checks if your websites are up. If they are down, it creates a new issue in your repository. This same workflow also closes any issues after your websites have come back up

# Upptime also supports notifications, assigning issues, and more
# See https://upptime.js.org/docs/configuration
